# EuRP-Plugins
**The EuRoleplay schema is now owned by the LemonPunch community, this release has been approved by them.**  
  
**The repository is still in an incomplete state and lacks a lot of documentation meaning that if you want to get a plugins you will have to figure it out on your own.**
  
These plugins have been created for **NutScript 1.0** and won't work for NutScript 1.1 unless you convert them which should be relatively easy as you only need to update some functions and methods names that changed from 1.0 to 1.1.  
Keep in mind that as per the license you need to share your updates to the plugins, preferably via a pull-request to the 1.1 branch of the repository.

**Note:** I won't be providing any new or upgrade plugins, feature requests will be **denied**.
